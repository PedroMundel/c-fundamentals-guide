This repository contains a concise collection of foundational C programming examples. It’s intended for those beginning their journey with the C language, focusing on practical, readable code that demonstrates core concepts.

## Included Topics

Each file targets a specific topic in the language:
(...)
- `10_ifStatements.c` – Conditional logic with `if`, `else`, and ternary operators  
- `11_switchStatements.c` – Using `switch` statements for branching control  
- `12_structs.c` – Structs for defining custom data types  
- `13_whileLoops.c` – Looping with `while` and `do-while` constructs  
- `14_guessingGame.c` – A basic interactive guessing game  
- `16_twoDArrays_&_nestedLoops.c` – 2D arrays and nested iteration  
- `17_memoryAdresses.c` – Inspecting memory addresses of variables  
- `18_pointers.c` – Introduction to pointers and memory references  
- `19_dereferencingPointers.c` – Accessing data via pointer dereferencing
  
## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)
- Familiarity with basic command-line usage

## Running the Code

To compile and run a file:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
